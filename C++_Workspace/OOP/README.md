# Object Oriented Programming
This is the folder that I am using for OOP. I use this workspace so that I can go between my different computers easily and it also keeps me from having to make too many repositories.

## Commits
Since this is one of my other workspaces, I will structure my commits so that you might know that what was committed here is different that what I've committed elsewhere. The messages will follow this basic structure:

```
OOP Commit - [date]: [3460:421-001] [purpose]
```

## Projects And Folders
Any and all projects or folders will be stored here as folders and inside will contain the source code for each project. I will try to keep naming schemes the same in class, and each day I will try to go back and differentiate between the ones that are projects and the ones that are just exercises by adding a `_Project` or `_Exercise` or `_Note` suffix at the end of each folder so that they are a bit more distinguishable
