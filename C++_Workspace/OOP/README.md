# Object Oriented Programming
This is the folder that I am using for OOP. I use this workspace 
so that I can go between my different computers easily and it 
also keeps me from having to make too many repositories.

## Commits
Since this is one of my other workspaces, I will structure my 
commits so that you might know that what was committed here is 
different that what I've committed elsewhere. The messages will 
follow this basic structure:

```
OOP Commit - [date]: [3460:421-001] [purpose]
```

## Projects And Folders
Any and all projects or folders will be stored here as folders 
and inside will contain the source code for each project. I will 
try to keep naming schemes the same in class, and each day I will 
try to go back and differentiate between the ones that are 
projects and the ones that are just exercises by adding a 
`_Project` or `_Exercise` or `_Note` suffix at the end of each 
folder so that they are a bit more distinguishable

On top of that, for my sanity (and hopefully yours), I will also 
be creating a `Notes`, `Projects` and `Exercises` directories 
while still keeping the same suffixes on the files.

## Changelog
**02/28/19:**\
- Rearranged file structure to Notes, Exercises, and Projects.\
- Updated README to rereference the new structure
**Notes:**\
	Each folder will still have the same post flag at the end, but 
	they will be placed in each respective directory.
